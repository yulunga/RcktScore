# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file is the short operating guide for the `RcktScore` repository.
It should describe the codebase as it exists now, not as it is planned to be.

When the product, API surface, security posture, or troubleshooting path changes,
update this file together with:

- [docs/backend-api.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/backend-api.md)
- [docs/technical-walkthrough.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/technical-walkthrough.md)
- [docs/troubleshooting.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Current Product State

`RcktScore` v2 is the active app in this repository.

Current stack:

- React + Vite frontend in `frontend/`
- Python AWS Lambda backend in `backend/`
- Supabase Postgres as the primary datastore
- AWS SAM for backend deployment
- native iOS client in `mobile/ios/`

The old Flask code in `version1/` is reference-only and should not be treated as the active product.

## Current Release Posture

The repository is closest to a web beta than a full production launch.

What is real and implemented:

- org-user login with backend session tokens
- multi-organisation membership selection
- dashboard, history, and match lists
- organisation settings, user creation, user role updates, and court CRUD
- match create, schedule, start, score, event actions, undo, and end
- register-interest, password reset, and feedback email flows
- root-admin UI and supporting backend functions

What is still partial or risky:

- root-admin backend authorization is not fully implemented
- some root-admin organisation actions use `x-root-admin-request` header bypass logic
- WebSocket broadcast infrastructure is scaffolded but not fully wired
- some settings sections are still UI scaffolds only
- no automated test suite is checked into the repo

## Current Frontend Routes

Defined in [frontend/src/App.jsx](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/frontend/src/App.jsx):

- `/` and `/login`
- `/help`
- `/dashboard`
- `/matches`
- `/history`
- `/settings`
- `/ping`
- `/match/new`
- `/match/:matchId`
- `/display`
- `/rckscoreAdmin`
- `/rckscoreAdmin/dashboard`
- `/rckscoreAdmin/clubs/:organizationId`
- `/rckscoreAdmin/interests`
- `/rckscoreAdmin/personal-accounts`

## Current Backend API Groups

Defined in [backend/template.yaml](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/backend/template.yaml):

- authentication and session
- password reset and membership approval
- root-admin operations
- dashboard and organisation settings
- personal profile
- user and court administration
- match setup lookup
- match lifecycle and scoring

See the backend/API reference for the exact route list.

## Security Notes

- org-user session enforcement is real in `backend/common/session_logic.py`
- scoring and organisation endpoints are tenant-aware through backend authorization checks
- root-admin login is real, but root-admin session/token enforcement is not yet implemented as a backend-wide control
- do not describe the current root-admin surface as fully secured
- do not describe WebSocket live display as production-complete

## Troubleshooting Entry Points

Use these first:

- [docs/troubleshooting.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/troubleshooting.md)
- [docs/backend-api.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/backend-api.md)
- [docs/technical-walkthrough.md](/Users/glennrowe/Development/Projects/RcktScore/docs/technical-walkthrough.md)

Fast local verification commands:

```bash
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/rcktscore-pyc python3 -m py_compile $(find backend/common backend/functions -name '*.py' | sort)
cd frontend && npm run build -- --outDir /tmp/rcktscore-frontend-dist
```
